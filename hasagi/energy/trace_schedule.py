"""Turn a real carbon trace into schedules for the carbon-policy simulators.

The Pareto/deferral simulators take a per-window intensity list cycled over
time. This adapts a real ``CarbonTrace`` (e.g. an ElectricityMaps zone export)
into that form, and — crucially for honest statistics — yields multiple
schedules that start at *different* points in the diurnal cycle.

The earlier synthetic traces shared one diurnal phase across every seed, so the
seeds were not independent draws (effective N collapsed). Sampling a real trace
at staggered start offsets gives genuinely different real-day realisations: the
start offset is the replication unit, decoupled from a single fixed phase.

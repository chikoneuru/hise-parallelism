"""What happens to the freed GPU decides whether carbon-aware pause wins.

A paused job on a *shared* card, measured with marginal attribution, has an idle
cost of ~0 — the co-tenant draws the idle either way. But that is only one of
three regimes for the GPU a paused job releases:

  - ``dedicated``    — the card stays ours and idles. We are billed its idle
                       floor for the whole pause, at the (dirty) pause-window
                       intensity. Pause often loses here.
  - ``reallocated``  — the freed card runs another tenant's work. Our job is
                       billed ~0 idle (the co-tenant pays). This is the shared
                       GPU we are actually on.
  - ``powered_down`` — the card is released / spun down. ~0 idle, plus an
                       optional one-off spin-down/up energy.

The measured marginal ledger is regime-independent for the active and cold-start
phases (that is our job's own draw). The regimes differ only in how the *idle*
phases are charged. ``regime_carbon`` recomputes the total under a given regime;
``break_even_window_s`` gives the dirty-window length beyond which pausing beats
riding through, for that regime.

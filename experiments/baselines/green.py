"""GREEN scheduler port (Xu et al., NSDI 2025) — temporal carbon-shift baseline.

GREEN's temporal shifter (§6, MLFQ Carbon Footprint Optimizer): pause jobs
during high-intensity windows and resume during low-intensity windows, subject
to maintaining the total allocated resources within a daily flexibility window.
This port captures the core scheduling decision as a per-tick (carbon-aware
on/off) function, with two flavours suitable for an apples-to-apples comparison
against HISE's threshold-pause policy:

  - **offline-optimal** — knows the full intensity trace; pauses the top-K
    highest-intensity ticks where K = pause_budget. Theoretical upper bound on
    temporal-shift savings (the "oracle" baseline GREEN's online algorithm
    approximates).
  - **online-percentile** — rolling-window estimator. At each tick, pauses if
    the current intensity sits in the top ``pause_fraction`` of the past
    ``window_seconds``. Realistic deployable policy that mirrors the way
    GREEN's online scheduler decides via percentile of recent carbon
    history.

Both flavours respect a *resource conservation* constraint: total active
ticks equals ``(1 - pause_fraction) × n_ticks``. HISE's simple
``pause if intensity > median × multiplier`` does NOT directly enforce this
constraint; instead its pause fraction emerges from the trace + threshold
combination. For the comparison, both policies are evaluated on the same
zone trace, and pause fractions are reported alongside savings so the
trade-off is visible.

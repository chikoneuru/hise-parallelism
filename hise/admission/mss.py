"""Minimum Satisfactory Share (ElasticFlow §4.1) and HISE's Energy-Budgeted MSS.

ElasticFlow defines MSS as the smallest GPU count ``x*`` such that the job's scaling curve
``T(x)`` is sufficient to finish before the deadline. Under a concave scaling curve we can
find ``x*`` by binary search.

HISE extends MSS along the **energy axis** (research-note §3.5 Gap-3, §4.5 C3):

* **EnergyBudgetMSS** — primary contribution. Objective: smallest ``x`` whose projected
  energy ``∫ P(x, t) dt`` over the job's remaining duration fits the user's energy budget
  while still meeting the deadline. Energy is *measured directly* via NVML / RAPL during
  execution; the projection at admission time uses Zeus-style profiling (power-per-GPU as
  a function of allocation size).
* **CarbonProxyBudget** — *optional* derived view. If the user supplies a grid intensity
  forecast and a carbon budget, ``EnergyBudgetMSS`` translates the carbon budget into an
  equivalent energy budget via ``B_E = B_C / max(c_grid(t))`` (worst-case) and reports
  carbon estimate with uncertainty band tracked separately. Carbon is never the primary
  decision input — only a re-weighting on the energy objective.

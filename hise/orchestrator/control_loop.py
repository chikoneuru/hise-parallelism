"""The orchestrator's main control loop — the closed-loop feedback that ties HISE together.

Each tick:
    1. Pull current carbon intensity from the energy scheduler (or trace replay).
    2. For each admitted job, ask the energy policy for a target GPU count.
    3. Run the planner to pick a new (dp, mp) strategy under that target.
    4. Tell the pool manager to scale workers; tell workers about the new partition.
    5. Update job state, record metrics.

Implemented as a plain callable so we can unit-test it deterministically and also run it
from FastAPI (`api.py`) as a background task.

"""Mid-run deadline floor: re-evaluate the MSS each tick.

The admission helper (``energy_admit_or_drop``) checks the deadline + energy
budget exactly once at submission. After that the scheduler is free to
throttle or scale down to save energy, but if the job's remaining work no
longer fits its remaining wall-clock budget, an energy-only policy has no
way to notice.

``DeadlineFloorSelector`` plugs that gap. Each tick it computes the
*deadline floor* — the smallest GPU count that still finishes the
remaining iterations before the deadline — and exposes it to the control
loop so the loop can override any energy decision that drops below the
floor. When the job is already infeasible (deadline missed, no allocation
meets it), the selector returns ``max_gpus`` so the loop hands the job
every GPU available and the operator can act on the resulting failure.

Independent of the energy axis: the floor only encodes "you must run this
fast or faster"; it never asks for *more* GPUs than the deadline needs.
The energy policy is free to pick anything ``>= floor``.
